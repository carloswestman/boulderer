# Boulderer 
>Hybrid mobile application for sharing boulder problems within the climbing community

I started Boulderer with two goals in mind, one social and the other one personal:

- <b>A social vision:</b> To provide an useful tool to the climbing community. Climbers can use their phones to discover, create and share boulder problems in the climbing gym and in the outdoors. Finding boulder problems in the Gym and the outdoors is a common problem between climbers. The information can be shared in different ways, but sometimes its also lost. The aplication should enable friends to share boulder problems with the help of a social network, easy to use, and free.
- <b>A challenge:</b> This is my first open source project where I can test and improve my skills designing and developing Mobile Application's technology. In this first round I have implemented the solution using an Ionic MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS), and Cordova to test the thevelopment of Hybrid Mobile Apps.

## Features

Features are focusing on escencial funtionality to make the application useful while keeping it simple. Current support with examples:

###Discover boulders in the outdoors

The easiest way to search for boulders is in the Map tab.
Double-tap markers to open the boulder.

</div>

###Discover Boulder Problems in climbing gym:
When you are in the climbing gym, there are too many boulders, and they are usually in the same place so the map won't be useful. The easies way to browse trough boulders is in the Boulder Tab. You can setup filters to only view the boulders you are interested in.

## Roadmap

There is so much work to do, but it's exciting. Here there is a list with some of the roadmap activities:

1. Create the Github repository with a MVP version *[DONE]*
2. Code Refactoring *[It's ugly and not clean]*
 1. Cleaning sprint
 2. Improve accuracy of geolocation web service
 3. Test the frontend in Android
 4. Go into the Android and Apple stores.
3. Improve UX *[Designers needed]*
4. Develop the product Branding *[Designers needed]*
4. Develop a business model to mantain the service
5. Distribute

## Architecture

The architecture stack relies heavily on <b>JavasScript</b>. and lightweight frameworks aimed to develop scalable web solutions. I think performace of the backend is pretty solid. I am still wondering if I should follow a native approach for the frontends:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Back-end @AWS</td>
   <td>Web API: <b>NodeJS</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td>Document storage: <b>MongoDB</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td>Data Model: <b>Express</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Front-End @PhoneGap</td>
    <td>Framework: <b>AngularJS</b></td> 
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>UX components: <b>Ionic</b></td> 
  </tr>
</table>
